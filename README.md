# Eagle-Components
Edited components more suitable for CNC and Toner Transfer in my.rar.

pcbGcode was used with older versions of Eagle to generate gcode cnc files directly from Eagle. With new versions of Eagle, Gcode is produced by first using Fusion to make Gerber files and then Flatcam to generate gcode.

The mirror ulp is used be new versions of Eagle to mirror layers appropriate for cutting using cnc.
