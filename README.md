# Eagle-Components
Edited components more suitable for CNC and Toner Transfer in my.rar.

Pcb-Gcode was used with older versions of Eagle to generate gcode cnc files directly from Eagle. With new versions of Eagle, Gcode is produced by first using Fusion to make Gerber files and then Flatcam to generate gcode.

The mirror ulp is used by new versions of Eagle to mirror layers appropriate for cutting using cnc.

my.rar contains component libraries that have had some components modified to work better with desktop cnc routers.
